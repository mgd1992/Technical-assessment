# **Cash Register App** ðŸ›’

## **Overview**
This project is a simple **cash register** system that allows adding products to a cart, calculating the total price, and applying special discount rules based on the product type.

## **Features**

âœ… Adds products to the cart.

âœ… Calculates the total price dynamically.

âœ… Applies discounts or special rules based on the product.


## **Products and Pricing**

| Product Code | Name         | Price  |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| GR1         | Green Tea   | â‚¬3.11  |
| SR1         | Strawberries | â‚¬5.00  |
| CF1         | Coffee      | â‚¬11.23 |

### **Special Pricing Rules**
- **Buy-One-Get-One-Free (Green Tea - GR1)**: If you buy **2 or more**, you only pay for half of them.
- **Bulk Discount (Strawberries - SR1)**: If you buy **3 or more**, the price drops to **â‚¬4.50** per unit.
- **Volume Discount (Coffee - CF1)**: If you buy **3 or more**, the price of each unit drops to **2/3 of the original price**.

## **Defining the Solution**
We built a `Cart` class that can:

âœ” Add products to the cart.

âœ” Calculate the total price while applying discount rules.

Basic Structure:

- A Cart class with methods to add products and calculate the total.
- A dictionary of products with their prices for easy reference.
- Rules for each special product (Green Tea, Strawberries, Coffee).
